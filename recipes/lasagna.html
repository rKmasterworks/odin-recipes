    <b>Lasagna Ingredients</b>
    <br>
    The Allrecipes community adores this lasagna recipe because it's incredibly customizable, 
    <br>
    so you can easily alter the ingredient list to suit your needs. 
    <br>
    If you want to stay true to the original recipe, though, these are the ingredients you'll need to add to your grocery list:

    <b>Ingredients</b>
    <br>
    <b>Meat:</b> This super meaty lasagna has sweet Italian sausage and lean ground beef.
    <b>Onion and garlic:</b> An onion and two cloves of garlic are cooked with the meat to add tons of flavor.
    <b>Tomato products:</b> You'll need a can of crushed tomatoes, two cans of tomato sauce, and two cans of tomato paste.
    <b>Sugar:</b> Two tablespoons of white sugar add subtle sweetness and enhance the flavor of the sauce.
    <b>Spices and seasonings:</b> This lasagna recipe is flavored with fresh parsley, dried basil leaves, salt, Italian seasoning, fennel seeds, and black pepper.
    <b>Lasagna noodles:</b> Use store-bought or homemade lasagna noodles.
    <b>Cheeses:</b> Parmesan, mozzassrella, and ricotta cheese make this lasagna extra decadent.
    <b>Egg:</b> An egg helps bind the ricotta so it doesn't ooze out of the lasagna when you cut into it.
